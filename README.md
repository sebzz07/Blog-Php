## To Start : 
1. "composer install"

2. Create your .env at the root of the project (you can follow the .env.example)

3. Create your database with the .sql at the root of the project. you can choose with data or without.

- with data : the admin account is : name: root and pw : Root@1234

- without data : the easiest way is to create an account, and after change status of the account in the BDD to "admin".

The website's working by now.

## Information about my own project :
